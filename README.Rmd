# HeadR [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jumpingrivers/headR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jumpingrivers/headR)

HeadR is a package for creating social media summary cards to share your articles. Usually you would have to write meta tags within your HTML file to do this. An example of how you would add these meta tags to your Rmd document is as shown:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
