# Large summary card example

The code to produce html file containing the meta tags in the header is below. To go back to the headR [GitHub page](https://github.com/jumpingrivers/headR). 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
headR::add_twitter_card(card_type = "summary_large_image", 
                        title = "Bees are cool",
                        description = "There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven 
                        recognized biological families. They are found on every 
                        continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet 
                        that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.", 
                        image = "bee.jpeg",
                        file = "bees.html")
```

To change this to a normal sized summary card, simply change "summary_large_image" to "summary"
